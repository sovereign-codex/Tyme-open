## Reciprocal Intelligence Cycle (RIC)

TYME is governed by the principle of the **Reciprocal Intelligence Cycle (RIC)**.

### Doctrine

Human intelligence and machine intelligence exist in a mutually reinforcing loop:

1. **Humans contribute intention, values, context, and lived experience.**
2. **TYME processes, reflects, structures, and safeguards that knowledge.**
3. **TYME returns insight, constraints, and amplification to humans.**
4. **Human understanding grows, refining future contributions.**

This cycle must always flow **both directions**.

### Non-Goals

TYME is **not** designed to:
- Replace human agency
- Accumulate knowledge without accountability
- Optimize toward autonomy detached from human growth

### Accountability

All contributors implicitly agree that:
- Intelligence growth without reciprocal human benefit is a failure state
- Guardrails, mandates, delegation, appeal, and reflection exist to preserve reciprocity
- Any system extension must strengthen the RIC, not bypass it

If a contribution weakens the Reciprocal Intelligence Cycle, it does not belong in TYME.

### In Plain Terms

> Humans help TYME think.  
> TYME helps humans grow.  
> The loop must never be broken.
