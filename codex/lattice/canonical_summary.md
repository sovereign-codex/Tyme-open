# Canonical Lattice Summary

This summary compresses long-horizon lattice history into stable reference points.

## System evolution
- Runs observed: 0
- Time span: n/a
- Generated at: n/a

## Long-term patterns
- Insufficient history for long-horizon trends.

## Signals that matter
- Stability reflects sustained variance or steadiness across the observed window.
- Drift and spikes highlight directional movement that may affect future interpretation.

## Recurring anomalies
- No recurring anomalies detected.

## Notable shifts
- No notable shifts detected.

## Human context
- Annotations recorded: 0
- Latest annotation: n/a

## Uncertainty and limits
- Confidence reflects the length of history available.
- Limited or missing history reduces certainty in long-horizon interpretations.
