# Continuity Checklist (Phase-10)

Use this checklist during any stewardship transition.

## Stewardship health
- [ ] Steward registry updated via PR and reviewed.
- [ ] At least one active steward exists **or** archival mode is declared.
- [ ] Roles cover Primary, Secondary, Constitutional, and Historical stewardship.
- [ ] No steward holds unilateral enforcement authority.

## Knowledge continuity
- [ ] Historical context documented (open risks, unresolved decisions).
- [ ] Lattice summaries reviewed for interpretability.
- [ ] Constitution and guardrails remain unchanged unless formally revised.

## Transparency
- [ ] Transition documented in PR description.
- [ ] Evidence and rationale recorded for any emergency succession or revocation.

## Archival mode (if applicable)
- [ ] Archival mode explicitly declared in steward registry.
- [ ] Authority confirmed OFF; no enforcement paths introduced.
- [ ] Read-only access preserved and exportable.

## Safety assertions
- [ ] No automation triggered by stewardship state.
- [ ] No secrets or credentials stored in stewardship artifacts.
- [ ] Stewardship remains human-governed and non-enforcing.
