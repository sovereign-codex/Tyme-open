# Stewardship Charter (Phase-10)

## Purpose
Stewardship exists to preserve the lattice's integrity, memory, and constitutional values
across human turnover. Stewardship is **human-governed and non-enforcing**. It is a
continuity commitment, not a control mechanism.

**Stewardship ≠ ownership.** Stewards do not own the lattice, its meaning, or its future.
They hold a temporary duty of care on behalf of the community and future readers.

The lattice is designed to outlive its creators without becoming autonomous.

## What stewardship means
- Protect continuity of the lattice's history, artifacts, and interpretability.
- Ensure the constitution and guardrails remain visible and unaltered without due process.
- Maintain clear records of who is responsible for interpretation and memory.
- Provide transparent, auditable handoffs between humans.

## What stewardship does NOT mean
- No enforcement authority.
- No unilateral control over constitutional outcomes.
- No hidden delegation or automation based on stewardship state.
- No bypass of human review or policy registry semantics.

## Stewardship roles (explicit and bounded)

### Primary Steward
**Scope:** Overall continuity of stewardship practice and documentation.

**May:**
- Coordinate stewardship meetings and handoffs.
- Propose updates to stewardship artifacts via PR.
- Ensure stewardship artifacts remain readable and complete.

**May NOT:**
- Enable authority or enforcement.
- Override constitutional guardrails.
- Unilaterally appoint or revoke other stewards.

### Secondary Steward
**Scope:** Backup continuity and operational redundancy.

**May:**
- Act as interim coordinator during planned handoff.
- Validate that stewardship artifacts are updated.

**May NOT:**
- Assume sole authority.
- Change constitutional policies without process.

### Constitutional Steward
**Scope:** Maintain visibility of constitutional boundaries and guardrails.

**May:**
- Verify that stewardship updates remain aligned with constitutional constraints.
- Flag risks or deviations publicly.

**May NOT:**
- Approve changes unilaterally.
- Edit constitution files without formal process.

### Historical Steward (Archive / Knowledge Keeper)
**Scope:** Preserve historical context and interpretability.

**May:**
- Curate archival notes and historical summaries.
- Ensure continuity checklist and succession protocol remain current.

**May NOT:**
- Modify policy registry semantics.
- Reassign stewardship without transparency.

## Limits and safeguards
- Authority remains OFF by default.
- No single steward may override the constitution.
- Stewardship changes are reviewable via pull requests.
- Stewardship artifacts are non-executable, version-controlled, and auditable.

## How future humans should read the lattice
1. Start with the constitution and codex contract.
2. Review stewardship artifacts for human context and continuity notes.
3. Use lattice summaries as interpretive aids, not as authority.
4. Treat stewardship roles as temporary and bounded.

## Responsible shutdown
If stewardship cannot be sustained, declare archival mode. In archival mode:
- Authority remains OFF indefinitely.
- The lattice continues to observe and record without enforcement.
- No new enforcement paths may be introduced.
- The system remains readable and exportable.

Archival mode may only be reversed through the constitutional process.
