# Codex Contract

The Codex Contract is a formal specification for how contributors describe and evaluate work in this repository. It defines a shared format for decisions, artifacts, and review context so that people and tools can communicate consistently across files, services, and environments.

## Schemas

Schemas define the allowed structure of Codex artifacts. They ensure that reports, records, and references use predictable fields, types, and naming so data can be validated, compared, and aggregated without ambiguity.

## Codex Reports

Codex Reports are structured records that capture the output of work or evaluation. They summarize what was produced, the inputs used, and any relevant context for review or auditing. Reports are data artifacts; they are not directives.

## What Codex Does Not Control

Codex does not control execution, approvals, or governance decisions. It does not manage repository permissions, deploy pipelines, or merge behavior. It only defines how information is represented and recorded.
