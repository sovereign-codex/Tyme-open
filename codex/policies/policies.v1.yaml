  Tier-7 Codex Policy Registry.
  All policies defined in this file are SIMULATION-ONLY.
  No policy in this registry may block execution, fail workflows,
  gate merges, or trigger enforcement actions.
  This file establishes the lattice-ready policy surface
  used for observability, reasoning, and future non-blocking guidance.

invariants:
  - no_blocking: true
  - no_failures: true
  - no_gating: true
  - no_auto_merge_interference: true
  - evaluation_mode: observational

policies:

  - id: POL-001
    description: Detect potential secret material added to tracked files.
    scope: guardian
    severity: high
    simulate_only: true
    predicate: >
      Warn when newly added or modified content includes strings
      that resemble API keys, access tokens, or private keys.
    recommendation: >
      Remove secrets from source control and use secure secret
      storage mechanisms such as repository secrets or vaults.

  - id: POL-002
    description: Identify unusually large files introduced in changes.
    scope: cms
    severity: medium
    simulate_only: true
    predicate: >
      Warn when a newly added or modified file exceeds a reasonable
      size threshold for source control.
    recommendation: >
      Store large artifacts in approved storage locations and
      reference them instead of committing directly.

  - id: POL-003
    description: Highlight missing license headers on new source files.
    scope: directive
    severity: low
    simulate_only: true
    predicate: >
      Warn when a new source file lacks the standard project
      license header.
    recommendation: >
      Add the approved license header to all new source files.

  - id: POL-004
    description: Surface dependency changes without matching lockfile updates.
    scope: guardian
    severity: medium
    simulate_only: true
    predicate: >
      Warn when dependency manifests change without corresponding
      updates to lockfiles.
    recommendation: >
      Regenerate and commit the appropriate lockfiles.

  - id: POL-005
    description: Flag changes to critical configuration files without documentation updates.
    scope: directive
    severity: low
    simulate_only: true
    predicate: >
      Warn when configuration files are modified without updates
      to related documentation or changelogs.
    recommendation: >
      Update documentation to reflect configuration changes.

  - id: POL-006
    description: Detect unsafe execution patterns in code changes.
    scope: guardian
    severity: high
    simulate_only: true
    predicate: >
      Warn when new or modified code introduces dynamic execution,
      shell invocation, or unsafe evaluation in production paths.
    recommendation: >
      Refactor to safer APIs or document justification and safeguards.

  - id: POL-007
    description: Surface test coverage gaps for changed modules.
    scope: cms
    severity: medium
    simulate_only: true
    predicate: >
      Warn when code changes in core modules are not accompanied
      by related test updates.
    recommendation: >
      Add or update tests covering the modified behavior.

  - id: POL-008
    description: Highlight direct edits to generated or vendor-managed files.
    scope: directive
    severity: info
    simulate_only: true
    predicate: >
      Warn when changes are made directly in generated or
      vendor-managed files.
    recommendation: >
      Update the source of generation or vendor configuration instead.
