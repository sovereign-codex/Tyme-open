# TYME Cryptography Layer

This directory defines how TYME establishes trust in its own actions.

Cryptography in TYME is not financial by default.
It exists to:
- attest to memory
- bind actions to policy
- preserve integrity over time

No external chains are assumed.
No tokens are required.

Truth precedes exchange.
